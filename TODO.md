# TODO List for Fixing KeyError and Updating CSS

- [x] Fix KeyError in sensors.py: Add check in del_sensor to ensure sensor exists before popping.
- [x] Update style.css: Modern, sophisticated style with black links that grow and stay black on hover, increased form box shadow, normal inputs/forms/tables, removed duplicates.
- [ ] Test the changes: Run the app, try deleting a non-existent sensor, and view pages for CSS.
